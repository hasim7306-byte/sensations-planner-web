The previous AI engineer successfully developed Sensations To Go Planner, a comprehensive workforce management system. The development followed a logical progression from initial setup to core features like authentication, scheduling, time tracking, and leave management. Key iterations included enhancing user management for admins (creating/deleting users, setting passwords), implementing mobile responsiveness with a hamburger menu and optimized layouts, integrating custom branding with a logo and red color scheme, and crucially, developing a PHP-based web installer. The project transitioned from a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack to a PHP/MySQL single-file application for the installer, then back to the original stack for the main app files. The current state involves debugging issues where the installed PHP application is not fully functional beyond login, despite a migration script being provided to update the database schema. The user's last request was to enable  and  functions on DirectAdmin, but the AI engineer provided a solution to remove those requirements from the installer itself, which was then followed by the user stating that het doet niks meer.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a comprehensive workforce management system named Sensations To Go Planner.
**Core Functional Requirements:**
1.  **Authentication & User Management:** JWT-based login/registration, role-based access (Admin, Manager, Medewerker), Dutch interface. (Initial build)
    *   **Updates:** Admin-only login, fixed admin account (, ), ability for admin to create/delete users and set passwords. Removed general user registration.
2.  **Scheduling & Planning:** Visual interface, drag-and-drop shift planning, capacity planning per department, status tracking. (Initial build, then enhanced)
    *   **Updates:** Full-fledged schedule system, integration of functions (bezorger fiets, bezorger auto, keuken, balie medewerker), display of shifts and approved leave on the schedule.
3.  **Time Registration:** Digital clock-in/out, automatic hour calculations, break tracking, manager approval workflow. (Initial build, then enhanced)
    *   **Updates:** Integrated with scheduling so only scheduled employees can clock in/out.
4.  **Leave & Absence Management:** Digital leave requests, various types (holiday, sick, personal), manager approval, central overview. (Initial build, then enhanced)
    *   **Updates:** Manager/Admin approval workflow for leave requests, leave visibility on the schedule.
5.  **Team Communication:** Group chat, real-time messaging, system notifications. (Initial build)
6.  **Dashboard & Reporting:** Live statistics, employee overview, active shifts, pending leave. (Initial build)
7.  **Employee Management:** Complete employee database, role assignment, department management, hourly wage tracking. (Initial build, then enhanced)
    *   **Updates:** Added Functie (function) for employees: 'bezorger_fiets', 'bezorger_auto', 'keuken', 'balie_medewerker'.
8.  **Mobile Accessibility:** Make the entire system mobile responsive with a hamburger menu, mobile-friendly tables, and touch-optimized interface.
9.  **Branding:** Integrate a specific logo (Sensations To Go logo) and change the color scheme to red to match the logo.
10. **Deployment:** Create a  script for easy, self-hosted web server installation (PHP-based).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Application**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database) for the primary application.
-   **PHP/MySQL**: Used for the standalone web installer script () and the main application code after installation.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
-   **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS patterns and custom CSS for mobile accessibility.
-   **Database Schema Management**: SQL migrations for updating database tables.
-   **Environment Variables**:  for frontend API calls,  for backend DB access.
-   **UUIDs**: Used for primary keys instead of MongoDB ObjectIDs for JSON serializability.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The initial project structure provided was for a React frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB. However, a significant architectural shift occurred with the introduction of a PHP-based web installer that deploys a *PHP/MySQL* application.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : Originally the FastAPI backend, but after the PHP installer was introduced, the focus shifted to a PHP/MySQL stack. The FastAPI backend's relevance is now diminished, as the user is working with the PHP files.
-   , , : These were the initial React frontend files. They were extensively modified for UI/UX, mobile responsiveness, and branding. However, they are now bypassed by the PHP installer which creates an entirely new PHP-based frontend.
-   : This is the crucial file for deployment. It's a single PHP script that guides the user through a 6-step wizard to set up the MySQL database, create an admin user, generate configuration files, and create all the necessary PHP application files (, , , , , , , , , ). It includes styling and basic JavaScript.
-   : A PHP script created to specifically handle database schema changes, such as adding  to the  table and  to the  table, along with creating necessary indexes.
-   , , , , , , , : These are the core application files generated by the  script. They implement the full workforce management logic in PHP, interacting directly with a MySQL database.
-   , : These static assets are also generated by the  to provide styling and basic client-side interactivity for the PHP application.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   The user reported het doet niks meer (it does nothing anymore) after implementing the enhanced PHP application files and migration script, indicating a significant bug or incomplete setup.
-   The previous AI engineer's proposed fix for the  and  functions issue on shared hosting ( was created to address database migrations without these, and PHP files were given) might not have fully resolved the core application not working.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the process of debugging a critical issue where the installed PHP application was not functioning correctly beyond the login page. This problem arose after the user attempted to implement the latest set of changes:
1.  **Database Expansion**: Altering the  table to add  and the  table to add , and creating indexes.
2.  **Updated PHP Files**: Providing new versions of , , , , and  to implement new features like employee functions, integrated scheduling, and time tracking.
3.  **Migration Script**: A  file was created and instructed to be run by the user to apply the database schema changes.

After these changes, the user reported het doet niks meer (it does nothing anymore) and saw a blank page or an unresponsive application after logging in, despite the login page itself working. The AI engineer attempted a screenshot () which showed the login screen, then checked backend logs (), which showed  indicating the FastAPI backend was still running and responding to dashboard stats, but this doesn't reflect the state of the *PHP application* which is what the user is now running after the  created PHP files. The AI engineer's last action was to state they would fix the issue, likely in the frontend (referring to the PHP frontend, not React).

Diagnose why the PHP application is not working beyond the login page, focusing on server logs and file integrity.
